# obsidian-keep-sorted

An Obsidian plug-in to keep lines in a code block sorted

Place the content to be sorted in a code block named `keep-sorted`.

Example:

    ```keep-sorted
    oranges
    apples
    pears
    ```
    
The content will be sorted only in reading view. (This includes editing view
when live preview is turned on).

In this initial version, there is no way to control the sort order. And there is
no way to give a different sort key. Sorting is based on the alphabetic content
of the elements within the content.
