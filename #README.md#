# obsidian-keep-sorted

An Obsidian plug-in to keep list items sorted.

Place the following directive immediately preceding the list to be sorted:

Example:

```
<!-- keep-sorted -->
* Dog
* Cat
```

In this initial version, there is no way to control the sort order. And there is
no way to give a different sort key to individual items. Sorting is based on the
alphabetic content of the elements within the content, with case
folding. Sorting applies to both unordered (bullet) and ordered (numbered)
lists.
