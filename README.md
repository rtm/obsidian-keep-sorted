# obsidian-keep-sorted

An Obsidian plug-in to keep lines in a code block sorted

To the developer: Please start off by writing this README describing how the plugin works and some of its features, as a way of ensuring we are aligned on what it is supposed to do. Once you've done that, remove this note.

Note that if the contents of the `keep-sorted` block contain nested items, those items should be kept under their parents in the new order.
Do you have any good ideas about how to specify a custom sort order or sort key, so that for instance a line saying "Bob Myers" could be sorted using the key "Myers, Bob"?
